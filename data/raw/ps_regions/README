DESCRIPTION

The shapefiles include the following:

ps_model - model data computed polygons; dbf file includes all data described 
in ps_model_fields_README

ps_polynode - point file includes all nodes used to create polygons; dbf file 
includes id, coordinates, and name

ps_regions - polygon file includes regions discussed in the report (Admiralty 
Inlet, Hood Canal, Whidbey Basin, Main Basin, and South Sound)

ps_tidesta - point file of tide stations; dbf file includes station name, id, 
coordinates


For those who do not have ArcView, comma-delimited text files of ps_model, 
ps_polynode, and ps_tidesta were created.  ps_model coordinates represent the 
centroid of the polygons.

The shoreline used in the Puget Sound Tide Model can be obtained through the 
Washington State Department of Ecology (http://www.ecy.wa.gov/)

Refer to the metadata files for detailed information about each dataset.
